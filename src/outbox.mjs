// The shipping queue: which receipts have reached the control plane, and which

// record that outlives the machine.
//
// ADR 0001 called for SQLite at the edge. That was the right call when the
// edge also held the dashboard and needed indexed reads to answer "spend by
// client this month". In v3 those queries moved to the control plane, and what
// is left for the edge is append and ship — a log with a watermark, not a
// database. So this stays dependency-free and the plugin keeps installing with
// no build step, which is a property worth more than the query planner it
// gives up. If the edge ever needs to answer questions about its own history
// again, that is the moment to revisit it, not before.
//
// Positions are BYTE OFFSETS, not line numbers. The distinction is the whole
// point: reading from an offset costs what has been added, counting lines
// costs what exists. v1 re-read a 54MB transcript on every tool call for
// exactly this reason and it is the mistake worth not repeating.
//
// Deduplication is on the receipt HASH, not a sequence number. The hash is
// already unique, already tamper-evident, and already in every line, so
// at-least-once delivery needs no new field and no schema change: the server
// keeps what it has seen and ignores a repeat. A seq would have to be added
// outside the hashed body to avoid breaking existing chains, which would make
// it the one field in the record nothing protects.
