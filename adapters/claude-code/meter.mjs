// Where the money figure comes from — and, just as importantly, which source
// it came from.
//
// v1 and v2 computed spend themselves: parse the transcript, apply a weight
// table, price it against a hand-maintained list of ~20 models across four
// vendors. That was the only option when the tool was a daemon talking to a
// proxy. It is no longer, and it was never going to be right: Claude Code
// computes the same figure, and it can compute it at an organisation's
// CONTRACTED rates. A third-party price list is not merely stale-prone against
// that, it is unknowable — there is no public number to look up.
//
// So the harness's figure wins wherever we can get it. The catch is that
// PreToolUse is not handed it: cost reaches the status line, not the hook. The
// status line runs on every render, so it records what it is given and the
// hook reads it back. That makes the good source available without a daemon,
// and when it is missing — nobody pasted the statusLine block, or the session
// has not rendered yet — the transcript arithmetic is still there underneath.
//
// Every reading says which of the two it is, and that lands in the receipt. An
// auditor asking "how did you know what this cost" gets an answer instead of
// an assumption.
