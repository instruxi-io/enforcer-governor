// Per-session scratch files, swept.
//
// Two files are written per session and never removed: `cost-<id>.json` (the
// harness's own total, written by the status line) and `cursor-<id>.json` (how
// far the transcript has been read, plus the running spend). Both are
// per-session by necessity — that is what makes the transcript read O(what
// changed) instead of O(session) — and both stop meaning anything once the
// session is gone. Fifty sessions in, the directory is a hundred files nobody
// reads and nothing deletes.
//
// BY AGE, NOT BY SESSION END. Deleting the current session's files when
// SessionEnd fires is the obvious rule and the wrong one: SessionEnd also fires
// on /clear and on exit, and `--resume` brings the same session id back. The
// cursor is what stops the transcript being re-read from the top, so removing
// it on an exit that turns out to be temporary silently un-does the thing it
// exists for. Age answers the question the session id cannot: nothing has
// touched this file for a week, so no session is still using it.
//
// Re-reading is correct either way — readUsage recomputes the same total from
// offset 0 — so the cost of being wrong here is a slow first tool call, not a
// wrong number. Age keeps even that rare.
