// Ambient spend, always in the chrome. This is the one piece of this plugin a
// developer benefits from rather than tolerates: the governor stops being a
// dashboard you have to open and becomes a number you glance at.
//
// It now has a second job. Claude Code hands the status line — and ONLY the
// status line — its own cost figure, which can reflect an organisation's
// contracted rates and is therefore better than anything we can compute. The
// hooks never see it. So this records what it is given, and the gate reads it
// back on the next tool call. That is how the good number reaches the decision
// without a daemon standing between them.
//
// Nothing in this repo wires this up, and that is not an oversight: a plugin
// cannot declare a status line. `statusLine` is not a plugin.json field, and a
// plugin's settings.json honours only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`. So it
// is wired by hand — see Install in the README. Without that paste the
// governor still enforces; it just meters from the transcript instead.
