// Ship the record to the control plane — receipts as OTLP log records.
//
// The receipt file is the record on this machine; this makes it a record that
// outlives the machine and that the organisation can read across its fleet.
// It is the ONLY place the governor sends receipts anywhere, and it sends them
// with the Enforcer credential the machine already holds: there is no database
// or broker credential on the edge, and never will be.
//
// WHY OTLP. It is the standard telemetry protocol, Claude Code already speaks it
// for its own metrics and events, and the server accepts both on one endpoint.
// OTLP/JSON over fetch keeps the plugin dependency-free: no gRPC library, no
// protobuf runtime, nothing to build.
//
// WHAT IS SENT, per receipt: the exact entry text the governor hashed, its hash,
// and the hash it was chained to. The server recomputes sha256(prev + body) and
// refuses a record that does not match, so an edited line is caught THERE, not
// just by /enforcer-governor:verify here.
//
// WHEN. Never inside a hook's decision path: the hooks spawn bin/ship.mjs
// detached (see kick()), so a slow or absent network cannot add latency to a
// tool call. Delivery is at-least-once; the server skips a receipt it holds.
